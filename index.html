<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: August 07, 2025</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Cancelled Chrome Extension does not collect personal information, browsing history, or usage analytics. All operations, including ESG score matching and badge display, occur locally on your device. We value your privacy and have designed the extension to minimize data access and maximize transparency.</p>

<h2>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h2>

<h3>Personal Data</h3>
<p>Our extension does not collect or transmit any personally identifiable information. The ESG score lookup is performed locally within your browser and does not involve sending any personal data or browsing history to external servers.</p>

<h3>Usage Data</h3>
<p>We do not track or store your browsing history. The extension temporarily analyzes the current active tab’s content to identify the company name for score matching, but this is done locally and not logged or shared.</p>

<h3>Tracking Technologies and Cookies</h3>
<p>The Cancelled Chrome Extension does not use cookies, web beacons, tracking scripts, or similar technologies. No data is stored beyond what is necessary to enable functionality such as ESG badge display and score matching, and that data remains on your device.</p>

<h3>Chrome Extension Permissions</h3>
<p>To operate effectively, the Cancelled extension requests the following Chrome permissions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>activeTab</strong> – to access the content of the current tab when activated.</li>
  <li><strong>tabs</strong> – to identify which domain or company the user is currently visiting.</li>
  <li><strong>storage</strong> – to store temporary local data such as the last ESG score retrieved.</li>
  <li><strong>scripting</strong> – to dynamically run content scripts required for company name detection.</li>
</ul>
<p>These permissions are used solely for the ESG-matching functionality and never for tracking or profiling users.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.</p>
